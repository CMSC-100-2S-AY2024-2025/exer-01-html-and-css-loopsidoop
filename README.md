## How to create your own Github Page
1. Create a **public** repository on Github
2. **Clone** the repository and create your website (with your index.html and styles.css files).
3. After you're finished with your website, make sure to **add**, **commit**, and **push** your changes to Github.
4. In your repository, go to its **Settings**.
5. Under code and automation, go to **Pages**.
6. Under **branch**, select **main**.
7. Click **save**, and you're good to go! 


## Key Takeaways
Web development is always such an interesting thing to do. It is important to fully understand 
the fundamentals in html and css so that you can manage the more complicated parts as you develop your website. I always remind myself to be patient while creating the website and to follow a step-by-step approach.
